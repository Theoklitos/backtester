### Backtester

A simple FOREX strategy testing program written in python. 

It works by using a strategy as implemented in `strategy_1.py` and backtests it on historical data. The data is expected to be a CSV file generated by https://tickstory.com/, which uses data from Dukascopy.   

Utilizes one process per instrument. The results can be seen in the log and also in the generated charts, via plotly.
